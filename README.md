# Statement of Purpose: AIC Recruitment

I have had a keen interest in entrepreneurship since I discovered the possibility to create my own websites through coding when I was in tenth grade. In my first year of college, inspired by my institution and the breakthroughs in the AI world, I began to aim higher and developed a strong interest in AI technology.

My curiosity drove me into the infinite world of debugging, but it has all been worth it. I discovered and now enjoy local LLMs on my laptop (as my counter-attack for token limits), and I was fascinated by image generation so I tried stable diffusion on my local machine (because i didn't have money for midjourney) and above all it is all uncensored ~~so you get it.~~. The process of debugging has led to many discoveries, such as understanding CUDA, understanding temperature, CFG Scale, PyTorch and even expanding my VRAM in BIOS settings. In fact, I created my first AI-generated 45-second video on my local machine while sitting in the back row of my DIC lecture. [DO watch it here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1REqGC8osM8QrQcLelgMJiOVsgYD8Nd30/view?usp=sharing).
Additionally, I took a course to learn about training models and the fundamentals of AI and ML technology, all in my leisure time during the first year. I also developed a PDF-to-lecture tool using text-to-text and text-to-speech technologies to aid the education of the blinds.

But I won't stop there. I am eager to learn so much more in this field, and I am incredibly excited about the possibilities. My goal in joining the AI Community at IITB is to collaborate with people who share my interests. I want to participate in AI hackathons with smart peers and, driven by my enthusiasm, create valuable products that can solve real-world challenges. There is so much in the world that needs fixing, and I am determined to make a difference.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to be part of the AI Community at IITB and look forward to contributing and growing alongside like-minded individuals.
